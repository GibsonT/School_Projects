Project 2

    The purpose of this project is to create a SIC or SIC/XE program that takes
in 10 integers and flips their order. I implemented the ability to
insert a list via an input file. This file contains an arbitrary list of
integers, each separated by a newline. When done inputting numbers in the
file, there should be a period at the end. 

Example input:
~~~~~~
1
2
3
23
43
100
.
~~~~~~

    The limit is hard coded to 10 integers with a 10 digit limit, but
this may easily be edited within the source file by editing the
TINTS, PARIN, and ENDLP variables. This was achieved
by reading each line byte by byte, converting the ASCII value to
a read digit. Each digit is multiplied by 10 a number of times
based on its position in the line, and then added to the
total for that line.

    For reversing the list, I essentialy just used a temporary
variable as a holder, much like one would do in C. I then 
transverse the list using two markers that move back from the front,
and toward the front from the back, and swap the integers where the
markers are at. The markers are then incremented/decremented once each
iteration.

    The list of integers are stored in memory locations 104-122, and in
sic.log, I have two dumps from 100-200 showing the contents of the memory
both before and after the swap.
