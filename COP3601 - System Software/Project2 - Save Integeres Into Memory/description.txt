For this project you are to create a SIC or SIC/XE program that
will have 10 integers initialized in memory via WORD storage.

You should report in your documentation (or sic.log) the location of
the 10 integers. The task is to reverse the integers. You can show
the original list and reversed list of integer that appears using 
the d command in sicsim.  For example, if the integers were

93 50 197 55 96 65 74 92 43 8

you would report:

8 43 92 74 65 96 55 197 50 93

You should show the location of each list by editing sic.log

Your program should be general enough so that, by making only a couple
minor modifications, I could use more than 10 integers.

For 5 extra credit points, read in the integers rather than 
code them in the program.

Use turnin 

   turnin fn ree3404_2

where fn is the name of your shar file created as follows

   shar t doc t.lst t.obj sic.log > fn

Assume your source file is called t. 

sic.log should show appropriate dumps indicating the desired results
above.

You may include any other files as you desire in your shar. Be sure
to test the integrity of your shar by creating a new directory,
copying your shar file to the new directory, unsharing the project. 
Only after this testing procedure has been accomplished should you 
turnin your project. 

NOTE: The turnin date reported by turnin -d ree3404_2 will be the 
2 day late deadline rather than the on time date of the project. 
This allows for 2 day late projects. Use the date on the top of this
file for the ON TIME date.
